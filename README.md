# ImageMache
A python script that can use hundreds of pictures, scale them down and join them to formulate a larger picture.
Coded this a few months ago in roughly June/July of 2020. Last modified prepper.py file in August and fixed dimension inheritence in matcher.py in November 2020.
To run it, first place both python scripts in a folder. Edit prepper.py file to change the path for large number of smaller images/ dataset of images. best results with datset containing large number of colorful images, Tested with 5000, works perfectly. Make a folder named "Input" and place the image which you want made out of smaller images. Run Prepper.py first, then Matcher.py. Should return constructed image in "Output" folder.
